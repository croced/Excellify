# Excellify ⚡️
Small scale tool that creates a Google Sheet for a list of items (seperated by new lines) as a todo list.

⚠️ To use this tool:
- Clone this repository
- Create a Google Drive & Google Sheets API (https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Set up your API credentials (in this case, I used a Service Account)
- Make sure your credentials file is saved as '.config/gspread/service_account.json'
- Place any lists in this directory (as a '.txt' file, formatted as seen below)
